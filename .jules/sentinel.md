## 2025-01-22 - [Chart Component XSS]
**Vulnerability:** The `ChartContainer` component in `src/components/ui/chart.tsx` utilized `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to inject dynamic CSS variables, posing an XSS risk.
**Learning:** Recharts wrapper generated by shadcn/ui contained a legacy pattern for style injection that is insecure. Even though the input is a configuration object rather than direct user text, any potential future inclusion of unsanitized text in those objects could be rendered as HTML and executed.
**Prevention:** Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` when standard React children can accomplish the same outcome, as standard rendering safely encodes characters, inherently preventing execution of malicious tags.
